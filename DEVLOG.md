## 2026-07-13 — Semantic zoom + readability round (`24209c1`, `ab409bc`)

**Built**
- Full-map labels are collision-culled (priority: frontier, then mastery) —
  no overlapping text at any zoom.
- Tap-a-dot **glossary strip** under the map: name, mastery chip, definition,
  "Details ›" — quick keyword review without leaving the map.
- **Full-text fetch**: articles that arrived as feed snippets now pull the
  real story from the publisher page (heuristic readability: `<article>`
  paragraphs), then regenerate the on-device summary from real text.
- **Semantic zoom** (user's design insight): zooming in spreads positions
  while dots/lines/labels keep constant screen size — overview may overlap,
  zoom always resolves it. Past 1.8× every dot gets a label. Max zoom 5×.
- Settings headers → heavy near-black; streak pill on Progress header.

**Verified** 21 unit tests (4 new extraction tests) + 2 UI journeys.
Simulator screenshots confirmed a decluttered map and a complete Verge
article fetched in-app.

**Learned** Swift 6 strict concurrency flags pure helpers inside `@MainActor`
enums — mark them `nonisolated`. Fresh installs made every dot "recent"
(all pulsing); recency must exclude the initial seeding batch.

## 2026-07-12 — Habit system, Lego-blocks UX, Go deeper (`6714005`, `4f1d173`, `b2bb783`)

**Built**
- **Atomic Habits reading system**: 30 fresh articles/day intake cap (newest
  across all feeds win), daily goal card (tiny default: 3; ring + streak +
  goal-met celebration + haptic), goal picker in Settings.
- Full map became a **cluster archipelago** (each topic an island with a
  faint label) replacing the hairball; "Full map — one net" entry card.
- Article **concept primer** ("know these before you read") with definitions;
  word-level selection via UITextView (SwiftUI selects whole blocks only);
  original-link storage + Safari/Share toolbar buttons; snippet footer for
  publishers that ship no body text (measured: HF/OpenAI = 0 chars,
  DeepMind ~117, Verge ~724, VentureBeat ~14k).
- **"Go deeper"**: on-device AI expands any concept into 3–5 linked
  sub-concepts on its island — the "pull" direction of learning. New dots
  ripple for 24h.
- First install on the physical iPhone 14 Pro (command-line signing:
  team H6V64XZ8VA + devicectl).

**Learned** RSS body length is a publisher choice, not a bug. iPhone 14 Pro
(A16) has no Apple Intelligence → fallback paths must be first-class; BYO
API key (CareerPulse U4) will unlock generation there.

## 2026-07-07 — Full build day: M1→M6 + Knowledge Pack + polish (16 commits)

**Built** (from spec `TechPulse-Build-Spec.md` in one continuous run)
- **M1** skeleton: SwiftData models, 4-tab navigation, seeded feeds, design tokens.
- **M2** feed pipeline: tolerant RSS/Atom/RDF parser, offline cache,
  article view, BackgroundTasks refresh.
- **M3** on-device intelligence: Foundation Models summaries + concept
  extraction with @Generable; NaturalLanguage fallback.
- **M4** knowledge engine: mastery scoring (read +0.1 / known 1.0 / quiz +0.3 /
  decay −0.05·mo), embedding dedupe, concept sheet with "I know this".
- **M5** force-directed knowledge graph (TimelineView + Canvas) + Swift Charts.
- **M6** quiz mode (question card → result with mastery deltas), resume-seeded
  green dots, Siri App Intent, onboarding, app icon, cache pruning,
  11→17 unit tests + XCUITest journey with screenshot capture.
- **Knowledge Pack**: ~50-concept AI-engineer skill tree with prerequisite
  arrows; cluster overview with GAP badge; frontier ("ready to learn") rings;
  "YOUR NEXT DOT" gap-detector feed; staged learning path.
- Polish: professional icon (3 design iterations), concurrent feed fetch,
  vocabulary-matching fallback (killed junk concepts), quiz distractors from
  the same cluster, unread badge, haptics.
- Wrote `CareerPulse-Template.md` — career-agnostic spec (+ §10 universal
  runtime-customization mode) that later became the CareerPulse project.

**Learned** SwiftData traps on repeated per-test ModelContainer creation
alongside the live app container (share one in-memory container per suite);
batch deletes violate inverse relationships (delete row-by-row); UI tests
catch real bugs code review misses (future-dated RSS timestamps, quiz chip
spoiling its own answer, junk "LiNO" recommendations).
